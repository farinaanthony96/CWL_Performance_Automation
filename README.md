## Roadmap

I'd like to add a feature that updates the number of attacks left for each clan beneath the star / percentage count.

Any other ideas are welcome!


## Contributing

You are welcome to make contributions this project.

To contribute, ensure you have set the environment variables inside the ".env.example" file:
  - COC_API_TOKEN: The Clash of Clans API token you get from the Clash of Clans API documentation website
  - COC_CLAN_TAG: The clan tag of the clan you'd like to run the script on (include the "#")
  - GOOGLE_SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID: The ID of the Google Spreadsheet that you'd like to push the data to
    - Be sure to have a sheet for each month inside the spreadsheet. The data will push to the appropriate month. (January, February, March, etc.)

Be sure you rename the ".env.example" file to ".env" so the script can find the file!
